CREDIBILITY_SCORE: 45
SUMMARY: Intelligence Summary:

A bribery incident was reported to have occurred at the RTO office on an unspecified date. The reporter alleged that an officer, identified as Mr. Verma, demanded an additional 5000 rupees to clear their license. The reporter claimed to have photographic evidence of the incident, which was uploaded as part of the report. A case ID (CASE_ID_PLACEHOLDER) was assigned for tracking purposes. The incident is pending investigation and further action.
EXPLANATION: The narrative and evidence do not strongly align, which raises concerns about the credibility of the claim.
The lack of detailed information in the narrative and the limited relevance of the evidence to the claim are significant drawbacks.
While the user's behavior appears cooperative, their responses seem somewhat rehearsed, which affects their reliability.
